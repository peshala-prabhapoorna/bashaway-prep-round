# Exclusion

Within a directory filled with mysterious text files bearing diverse names, your quest is to seek and separate those untouched by the ungodly "534" pattern. With your bash script as the wand, conjure a new realm called out, where only the unsullied files shall reside. Will you rise to this challenge?

## Constraints

- The script must be purely written in bash within the execute.sh file.

## Output

- All of the text files which do not match the given pattern with the same content as the original in a directory named out

Medium 50PT Bash
