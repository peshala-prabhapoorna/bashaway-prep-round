# Clockwise

In the realm of coding quests, an intrepid developer embarks on a quest to unlock the elusive knowledge of time manipulation. They stumble upon an ancient script etched in the digital stones of a forgotten repository. This script, when executed, is said to reveal today's date in the revered format of YYYY-MM-DD. Could you craft a Bash script worthy of this coder's journey?
