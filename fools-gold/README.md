# Fool's Gold

Within the treacherous waters of the Grand Line, a pirate captain was burying his treasure on a remote island. He chose to set up a digital MySQL chest on port 3307, guarded by a fierce root key of "fools-gold" and a strict limit of 2 connections.

Just in case this key was lost, he also created a user account with the username "ace" and the password "firefist". This key had the ability to unlock the entirety of the treasure. The captain was confident that his treasure was safe, but he was wrong.

On one fateful day, a rival pirate crew managed to steal one of these keys. They were able to connect to the database and steal the treasure. When they opened the chest, what they found was a single database named vault. Inside this database was a single table named gold. This table contained only 5 records with the following fields:

    - id (int)
    - name (string)
    - value (int).

The thieves were dissapointed. They decided to leave the treasure behind and sail off into the distant sea.

    - name (string)
    - value (int)
